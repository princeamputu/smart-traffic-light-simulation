# Smart Traffic Light Simulation

A Python-based traffic light simulation for smart city systems.

## Overview
Simulates a sensor-driven traffic light system with RED, YELLOW, GREEN states. The system demonstrates the core logic behind adaptive traffic management.

## Features
- Finite state machine controlling light transitions
- Configurable RED/YELLOW/GREEN timing
- Pygame visualization of traffic light
- Placeholder for future car sensor integration

## Skills Demonstrated
Python, Pygame, simulation logic, basic IoT concepts, problem-solving

## MY Next Steps
- Add simulated cars to test traffic flow
- Integrate random “sensor” input for adaptive timing
- Record a short demo video for portfolio
